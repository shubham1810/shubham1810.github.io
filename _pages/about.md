Hi! I'm an upcoming PhD candidate at the [RTG 2853 Neuroexplicit Models of Language, Vision, and Action](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/) at Saarland University, starting from September 2024. I will be co-supervised by [Prof. Philipp Slusallek](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/people/slusallek.html) and [Prof. Eddy Ilg](https://cvmp.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/#eddy-ilg).

Previously, I was working as a Senior Researcher at [Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India](https://mbrdi.co.in/) working on multi-modal research for vision, language and additional modalities. I have completed my Masters (MS Research, Computer Science) at __IIIT Hyderabad__, co-supervised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) from UCSD . Before that, I was working as a Research Engineer at [Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India](https://mbrdi.co.in/), on the [MBUX](https://media.mercedes-benz.com/s-class) Interior Assistant using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

I finished my undergraduate from __Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE)__ in 2017, with a degree in Mathematics and Computing. I have been lucky to receive mentorship by some amazing people including [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/), [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/anbumani/), and [Dr. Ganesh Bagler](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~bagler/).

I love to explore different problems, especially in computer vision, and experiment with different domains frequently. Sometimes, it ends up in something useful, other times it's a good learning experience. I try to share my random thoughts on [my blog](/blog).


<!-- When I'm not doing academic stuff, I may be spotted in a peaceful corner indulging in some of my hobbies (sketching, gaming, reading, playing my guitar/ukulele, or just taking a nap!). -->

Have a look at my [__CV__](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) for more formal details!
